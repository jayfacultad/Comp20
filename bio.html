        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><a class="biopara">Jay Facultad (b. 04 August, 1986) was a half-blood wizard, one of the most famous wizards of modern times. He was the only child and son of James and Lily Facultad, both members of the original Order of the Phoenix. Jay's birth was overshadowed by a prophecy, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish Lord Voldemort. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort courtesy of Severus Snape, Jay was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. This caused the Facultad family to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first vain attempt to circumvent the prophecy when Jay was a year and three months old. During this attempt he murdered Jay's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Jay led to Voldemort's first downfall. This downfall marked the end of the First Wizarding War, and to Jay henceforth being known as the "Boy Who Lived".</a></p>
        <p><a class="biopara">One consequence of Lily's loving sacrifice was that her orphaned son had to be raised by her only remaining blood relative, his Muggle aunt Petunia Dursley. While in her care he would be protected from Lord Voldemort, due to the Bond of Blood charm Albus Dumbledore placed upon him. This powerful charm would protect him until he became of age, or no longer called his aunt's house home. Jay's time with the Durselys was harsh, but necessary. As the only known survivor of the Killing Curse (up to that point), Jay was already famous before he arrived at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</a></p>
        <p><a class="biopara">On his eleventh birthday, Jay learned that he was a wizard. He began attending Hogwarts in 1997 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. While at school Jay became best friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He later became the youngest Quidditch Seeker in over a century and eventually the captain of his house's team, winning two Quidditch Cups. He became even better known in his early years for protecting the Philosopher's Stone from Voldemort, saving Ron's sister Ginny Weasley, solving the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, slaying Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, and learning how to conjure a corporeal stag Patronus at the age of thirteen. In his fourth year, Jay won the Triwizard Tournament, although the competition ended with the tragic death of Cedric Diggory and the return of Lord Voldemort. During the next school year, Jay reluctantly taught and led Dumbledore's Army. He also fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, during which he lost his godfather, Sirius Black.</a></p>
